# Quiz App for CS Students - Client

## Introduction

In my last year of college, we were required to pass an exam (quiz) in order to be able to present our final project. I made a full stack app to help me and my colleagues prepare for this exam. This is the frontend client. The backend API can be found [here](https://github.com/crististoica/quiz-app-remaster-api)

[Live Demo](https://quiz-client-remaster.vercel.app/) -> the backend API is on a free shared hosting so it takes around 15 - 20 seconds the first time it boots up

## Made with

    - ReactJS
    - Redux
    - MATERIAL-UI

## Features:

    - UI for quizzes
    - UI for community
    - UI for admin dashboard
